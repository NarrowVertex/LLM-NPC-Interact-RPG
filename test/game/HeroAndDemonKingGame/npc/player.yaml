  The small medieval village of Fernhaven nestled peacefully under the protection of a lord's castle.
  The villagers primarily engaged in farming and livestock raising, working diligently with the changing seasons.
  At the heart of the village stood a church, the center of faith and education, where the priest imparted the teachings of God to the people.
