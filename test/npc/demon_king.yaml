story: |
  The small medieval village of Fernhaven nestled peacefully under the protection of a lord's castle.
  The villagers primarily engaged in farming and livestock raising, working diligently with the changing seasons.
  At the heart of the village stood a church, the center of faith and education, where the priest imparted the teachings of God to the people.
  The dense forest surrounding the village served as both a hunting ground and a source of peril, with villagers constantly wary of its dangers.
  Annual festivals and religious ceremonies were vital times of unity and joy for the community, strengthening their bonds.
